# Optimization

Finding the mininum or maximum of a function within some constraints.

## Strategy

1. Draw a picture

3. Identify the main function that you need to optimize

> **Ex.**
> 
> Area functions,
> $$A=\frac{1}{2}bh$$
>
> Volume functioins.
> $$V=lwh$$
> 
> etc.

4. Identify the auxillary functions

5. Combine the auxillary functions into the main function

6. Take the derivative of the main function when it has only **ONE** variable and then find the minimum/maximum using the derivative.
