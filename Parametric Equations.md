 # Parametric Equations
 
 **Parametric Equation** - Group of functions where the function's dependent variables are indepdent from each other, and use external variables as their indepedent variables.
 
> **Ex.**
> Instead of defining $y$ as $y=f(x)$ and $x$ as $x=g(y)$, we define them as $y=f(b)$ and $x=g(b)$, so they now use an third external variable, $b$, as their independent variables instead of each other.

Most commonly used in 2-D [[motion]] problems with two functions that describe the $x$ and $y$ position of an object over time using $y=f(t)$ and $x=g(t)$.

Often times problems involving parametric equations also use [[function-related integrals]]
