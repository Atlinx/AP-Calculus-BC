## Logistic Growth

Logistic growth is exponential growth that slows down as it nears a maximum population size.

For a population with a population $P$ at time $t$,

$$\huge \frac{dP}{dt} = kP \left(1 - \frac{P}{M} \right)$$

> **LEGEND:**
> $k$ - Constant of proportionality, which determines how fast the growth happens.
> $P$ - Population count.
> $M$ - Maximum population size.

## Exponential Growth

On the other hand if growth is unrestricted and gets faster over time, we would have exponential growth.

For a population with a population $P$ at time $t$,

$$\huge \frac{dP}{dt} = kP$$

> $P$ - Population count.
> $M$ - Maximum population size.
