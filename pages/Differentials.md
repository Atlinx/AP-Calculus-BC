# Differentials

**Average Rate of Change** - The average change (slope) of a function between two points.

**Instantaneous Rate of Change (IoC)** - The change (slope) of a function at a single point. This slope is tangent to the function at that point.

## Derivative

A function that measures the rate of change of another function.

A point on a derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change of that point on the original function.

**Differentiability** - A function is differentiable at a point $x=c$, if it's derivative exists at $x=c$.

### Limit Definition of a Derivative

$$
\huge
\begin{aligned}
& f'(x) = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\
& f'(x) = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Notation:

> **NOTE:**
> $f(x) = y$

### Lagrange

$f'(x)$ means the "first derivative of $f(x)$."
$f''(x)$ means the "second derivative of $f(x)$."
$f'''(x)$ means the "third derivative of $f(x)$."

$\ldots$

$f^{(n)}(x)$ means the "$\text{nth}$ derivative of $f(x)$."

Lagrange notation is assumed to be of $y$ with respect to $x$ by default.

Also known as **"Prime Notation,"** since it comes from the use of tick marks commonly used in geometry to indicate a different version of the same point.

### Leibniz

$\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ means the "first derivative of $y$ with respect to x."

$\dfrac{d^2y}{dx^2}$ means the "second derivative of $y$ with respect to x."

$\dfrac{d^3y}{dx^3}$ means the "third derivative of $y$ with respect to x."

$\ldots$

$\dfrac{d^ny}{dx^n}$ means the "$\text{nth}$ derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$.
