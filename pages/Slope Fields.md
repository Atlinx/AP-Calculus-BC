# Slope Fields

A slope field is a graphical representation of the possible solutions to a first-order differential equation.

The differential equation used for a slope field follows the form:

$$\Large \frac{dy}{dx} = \ldots$$


## Constructing a Slope Field

A slope field is built by going through each point on the a field of points and computing the slope at that point using the same differential equation. The slope of each point is then indicated with a small line that is tilted to match the slope at that point.

## Finding Solutions of a Differential Equation

If you pick a point $(x_1,y_1)$ on the slope field and then follow the slope at that point to another point and so forth until you have traced a line, you would be tracing a line that represents a possible solution for the field's differential equation. This possible solution would pass through your starting point of $(x_1,y_1)$.

## Variable Dependence

If a differential equation is only dependent on a single variable, lets say $x$ for example, then only changes in that variable's axis should change the shape of the graph.
