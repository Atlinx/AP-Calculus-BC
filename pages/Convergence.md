# Convergence

Convergence is a concept that applies to series, and is whether a series sums to a real number or not. In this sense, convegence is whether or not a series "converges" to a real number.

If a series sums to a real number, it is **convergent.** Otherwise, the series is  **divergent.**

Possible cases of divergence in a series are when:
- The sum is infinity
- The sum oscillates two between values

---

For power series, they have an intervals and radii of convergence.

**Interval of Convergence** - The interval of all $x$'s that make the series converge. 

**Radius of Convergence** - The radius of the interval of convergence. This is commonly denoted by $R$.

## Finding the Interval of Convergence

1. Use the ratio test to get the an inequality in the form of

$$
\Large
\begin{aligned}
|\ldots x\ldots| > 1
\end{aligned}
$$

> **NOTE:**
> This inequality comes from the ratio tests' conclusion that if the ratio $<1$, then the series converges.

2. Solve for $x$ to get the interval of convergence.

3. Test the end points of the interval of convergence to check if they converge. Make sure to include an end point if it converges.

> **NOTE:**
> We need to check the end points for convergence because the end points are when the ratio $=1$ and the ratio test is inconclusive when the ratio $=1$.

4. Divide the range of interval of convergence in half to get the radius of convergence.
