# Alternating Series Test

If a series $S$ with the $n\text{th}$ term of $a_n$ and

- $a_n$ is alternating from $+$ to $-$
- $a_n$ is decreasing in absolute value
- $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0$

then $S$ is convergent.

If a series $S$ with the $n\text{th}$ term of $a_n$ and

- $a_n$ is alternating from $+$ to $-$
- $a_n$ is increasing in absolute value **or** $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} a_n \neq 0$

then $S$ is divgerent by the [[nth Term Test]].
