# Average Area Below of a Function

$$\Large f(x)_\text{average}\bigg|_a^b = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^bf(x)dx$$

This is commonly used to find the average of a function's quanitity (velocity, amount of fish, etc.) over an interval. 

> **Ex.**
> The average velocity of an object from one point to another would be 
> $$\large v_\text{average} = \frac{1}{b - a} \int_a^b v(x)dx$$
