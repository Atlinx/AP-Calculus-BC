# Mistakes

## Extrema

> **NOTE:**
> You should know that existence of [[Second Derivative Test]] because even though the [[First Derivative Test]] is guaranteed to work, College Board still wants you to know how to use second derivative test.

## Continuity

> **NOTE:**
> Watch out for asymptotes!
> 
> **Ex.**
> What value of $k$ makes this function continuous? 
> $$
\Large
f(x) =
\begin{cases} 
  k^3 + x 			& x < 3 \\
  \dfrac{16}{k^2-x}	& x \ge 3 \\
\end{cases}
> $$
> 
> Keep in mind that $k^2$ must be $<3$, or else the second part $f(x)$ will have an **vertical asymptote due to the denominator**.
> 
> $(k^3 + 3)(k^2 - 3)-16=0$ is the function that holds the possible zeroes. 
> 
> We can find the zeroes using a calculator by graphing $y = (k^3 + 3)(k^2 - 3)-16$ and identifying where $y=0$.

## Trig Functions and Limits

> **NOTE:**
> $\tan^{-1}(x)$ and $\cot^{-1}(x)$ are the only trig functions that can handle limits of $x\to\infty$.
> 
> Make sure to not panic when seeing a trig function in an infinity limit.
