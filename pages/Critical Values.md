# Critical Values
Critical values are points of interest in the first-derivative of a function that describes the behaviour of the original function.

## Types

**Extrema**

> *Relative Extrema*
> 
> **Relative Maximum** - Point where the function is higher than the surrounding area. This often creates a hill
>
> **Relative Minimum** - Point where the function is lower than the surrounding area.

> *Absolute Extrema*
> 
> **Absolute Maximum** - Point with the highest possible value of the function in a given interval.
>
> **Absolute Minimum** - Point with the highest possible value of the function in a given interval.

**Saddle Point** - Point that is neither a minimum, a maximum or an endpoint. These points 

**Endpoints** - The points located on the two ends of an interval.

> **NOTE:**
> A point can be both a relative and an absolute maximum.
>
> However a point cannot be both a maximum and a minimum.

> **NOTE:**
> We will assume that endpoints cannot be relative extrema.
