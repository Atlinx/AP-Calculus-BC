# Continuity

**Continuous** - A function is continous if the function does not have any abrupt changes in value. This means you can trace a continous function with a single stroke without lifting your pencil. 

A function $f(x)$ is continous at $x=c$ if,
$$\huge \lim_{x\to x}f(x)=f(c)$$

## Discontinuities

**Jump Discontinuity** - When $\lim\limits_{x\to c^-}f(x)\neq\lim\limits_{x\to c^+}f(x)$, which creates a "jump" in value.

**Removable Discontinuity** - When $\lim\limits_{x\to c}f(x)$ exists but $f(c)$ is undefined. This means the function is smooth and there is a hole at that point.

**Infinite Discontinuity** - When $\lim\limits_{x\to c} = \infty$, which is caused by an asymptote.

**Infinite Oscillations** - When the function oscillates infinitely many time at $x=c$.
