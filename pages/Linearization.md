# Linearization

 Approximating a value of a function using a line.
 
 Given a value $f(x_1)=y_1$ and $f'(a)=c$, we can find a line that approximates the function.
 
 $$\Large y - y_1 = c(x - x_1)$$
 
 To use the approximation, you plug in an $x$ value and solve for $y$.

**Linear Approximation** - The a line used to approximate the values of a function.

 ## Accuracy of Estimation
 
 The accuracy of a linear approximation depends on the closeness of the point to the center of the line and also the concavity of $f(x)$ at the center of the line.
 
 If $f''(x) > 0$ or concave up, then the line is an underestimate.
 
 If $f''(x) < 0$ or concave down, then the line is an overestimate.
