$$\huge \int udv = uv - \int vdu + C$$

$$\huge \int_a^b udv = \left.\left( uv - \int vdu \right)\right|_a^b $$

> **NOTE:**
> This can be used to integrate functions like $ln(x)$ by assigning $u=ln(x)$ and $dv=dx$.

## How to Use

1. Split the function into two multipliable terms and decide which one is $u$ and which one is $dv$.

> **NOTE:**
> $dv$ will include $dx$!
> 
> **Ex.**
> $$\Large\int \cos(x)\sin(x)dx$$
> $\Large u = cos(x)$ and $\Large dv = sin(x)dx$

2. Take the derivative of $u$ to get $du$.
3. Integrate $dv$ to get $v$.
4. Plug the values into the formula above.
