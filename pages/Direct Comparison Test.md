Given a series $S$, a series $S_k$, and the fact that both series have $n\text{th}$ terms $>0$, if you know the convergence of $S_k$, then

$$
\Large
\begin{aligned}
& \text{If } S \geq S_k \text{ and } S_k \text{ diverges, then so does } S \\\\

& \text{If } S \leq S_k \text{ and } S_k \text{ converges, then so does } S \\
\end{aligned}
