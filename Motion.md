# Motion

**Displacement / Position** $\Large s(t)$ - The location of an object relative to where it started.

**Distance** $\Large d(t)$ - The total distance an object has travelled.

$$\Large d(t) = \int_a^b \text{speed} = \int_a^b\|v(t)\|$$

**Velocity** $\Large v(t)$ - The speed of an object along with the direction it's headed. 

$$\Large v(t) = s'(t)$$

**Speed** $\Large \|v(t)\|$ - How fast an object is moving over time.

**Acceleration** $\Large a(t)$ - The change in velocity of an object. 

$$\Large a(t) = v'(t)$$

> If an object's velocity and acceleration are in the **same** direction, the object is accelerating **(gaining speed)**.
> 
> If an object's velocity and acceleration are in **opposite** directions, the object is deccelerating **(losing speed).**


## 1-D Motion

**Speed:** 

$$\Large |v(t)| = |v(t)|$$

> $-$ normally means moving towards the left.
> $+$ normally means moving towards the right.

> This is based on a flat number line.

**Distance:**

$$\Large d(t) = \int_a^b |v(x)|$$

## 2-D Motion

Often uses [[parametric equations]] of $x$ and $y$, which both depend on $t$, the time since the start of the movement.

**Speed:** 

$$\Large \|v(t)\| = \sqrt{v_x^2+ v_y^2}$$

**Distance:**

$$\Large d(t) = \int_a^b \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$$
