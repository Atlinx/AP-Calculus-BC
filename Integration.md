# Integration

**Integral** - The operation of summing together of infinitesimal parts to form a whole. An integral by itself represents the area of the curve of the **integrand**.

**Integrand** - The function that is being integrated by an integral.

**Definite Integral** - Integral that is bounded by limits. The limits are indicated at the bottom and top of an integral symbol, respectively.

**Indefinite Integral** - The most general antiderivative of a function.

**Improper Integral** - Integral that is unbounded (goes to infinity) or contains a discontinuity.

> $F(x)$ is the antiderivative of $f(x)$.

If $f(x)$ is continous on $[a,b]$ and $a<x<b$ where
$$\Large F(x) = \int_a^xf(t)dt$$

**Part I**
Then,
$$\Large F'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\int_a^xf(x)$$

**Part II**
Then,
$$\Large \int_a^bf(x) = F(b) - F(a)$$

## Finding Integrals

Finding integrals is applying the reverse of many derivative rules.
To reverse the [[chain rule]], try using [[integration by parts]].
