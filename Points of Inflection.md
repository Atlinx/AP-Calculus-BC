# Points of Inflection

Points of inflection are the points of interest in the second-derivative of a function that describes the concavity of the original function.

## Concavity

The rate of change of a function's derivative. You will see this in the graph of $f(x)$ as a bowl shape that opens up either up or down.

**Concave Up** - The concavity of a section of $f(x)$ that makes a cup shape, ∪.
**Concave Down** - The concavity of a section of $f(x)$ that makes a cap shape, ∩.

## Finding Points of Inflection

Given a twice differentiable function $f(x)$,

**Point of Inflection** - Point where $f''(c)=0$ and changes signs. The function changes concavity at this point.

> **NOTE:**
> If $f''(c)=0$ but $f''(c)$ does not change sign, then the point is **NOT** an inflection point.
